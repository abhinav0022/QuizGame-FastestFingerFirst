The goal of the project was to build a multiplayer buzzer quiz game, where every player has toanswer each question correctly and as quickly as possible. The player with the quickestresponse and the most correct answers is the winner of the game. Thus, the name of the gameis titled “Fastest Finger First”. These types of games are commonly found in many gameshows on the television for eg, Temptation, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, etc.In many buzzer games, we often encounter cases where at least two or more players press thebuzzer around the same time, having a really small time difference. In these cases, it issomewhat impossible for a person to judge who pressed the buzzer first. Nonetheless, with theaid of digital system electronics, it is possible to measure time with a precision of picosecondshence, allowing us to make decisions more accurately and fairly.The basic gameplay: there will be 5 multiple choice questions where each question has 4options out of which only one option is correct. There will be 3 players who will answer eachquestion with the keyboard or the switches. Moreover, the keys of the fpga will act as a buzzerfor the players. The question is displayed on the VGA, player’s correct response is displayed onthe HEX and the LEDS, and at the end of the 5 questions, the winner is displayed on the HEXdisplay.
